        "description": "This 7-day plan is designed to help you explore the heart of faith in Jesus Christ, going beyond just knowing about Him to truly believing in Him. Each day focuses on a key aspect of faith, providing reflection points and Scripture to deepen your understanding.Day 1: Who Is Jesus? Believing in Jesus starts with knowing who He is. Jesus is the Son of God, the Savior of the world, fully God and fully man. He came to reveal Godâ€™s love, teach the truth, and offer salvation to all who believe in Him. ðŸ“– John 1:1-14, Matthew 16:13-17 Day 2: Why Do We Need a Savior? Sin separates us from God, but Jesus came to bridge that gap. His sacrifice on the cross paid for our sins, offering us forgiveness and eternal life. ðŸ“– Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23, 1 Peter 2:24",
