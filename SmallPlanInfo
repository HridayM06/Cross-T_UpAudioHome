            "Things like famines, diseases, natural disasters, genocide, and other horrific things haunt our world. God is all loving and all compassionate, true, but if this is the case, why do such harsh things occur on this planet? It's important to first split the issue into two sections: man-made hardships and natural hardships. Man-made hardships consist of things such as murder, sexual abuse, genocide, physical or emotional harm to others. Natural hardships consist of sicknesses, natural disasters, and famines.",
            "Man-made hardships—murder, genocide, sexual abuse, and physical or emotional harm—haunt our world as we know it. Believe it or not, these tragedies are a product of ourselves. In Genesis 2:16-17, God said to Adam and Eve: 'You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it, you will certainly die.' When God created the first humans, He gave them free will—just as we have today. However, as the story goes, Adam and Eve misused this gift, and through their disobedience, sin entered the world.",
            "So, free will—why do we have it? If God knows this leads to sin and wrongdoing, then why do we have it? The short answer is because He loves us and He wants us to love Him back as well. For genuine love to occur both ways, free will must be present. Imagine a world where everyone is programmed like robots to always obey, never question, and only do what they are told. If someone tells you, 'You love me,' but you've never had the choice not to love them, does that love mean anything? True love, real loyalty, and genuine goodness can only exist if people have the ability to choose otherwise. That’s why God gave us free will."
